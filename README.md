# My productivity i3-wm setup



## Introduction:

This is my custom **i3, Polybar, gnome-terminal, and Compton** setup designed for Ubuntu users "like myself" but will work anywhere for sure with some tweaks it was made to be a simple I3 with no fancy visual destructions everything is just tidy and in it's own place **(imo)**

## Getting started:

I've used 

* [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3)

* [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)

* [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton)

* [gnome-terminal](https://packages.ubuntu.com/disco/gnome-terminal)

we can follow each one's manual to install them or you can just run **install.sh** *(Tested on PopOs 19 virtual  machine)* make sure that all the repo's files are in the same directory git will do that for you

------

## installation: 

**Before installation: make sure you read at least the comments of install.sh file (IT'S A MUST)**

As mentioned above you can install each one of these wonderful pieces of software manually or you can just follow this:

### Ubuntu Users:

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Others:

Comment out aptitude's lines then install **i3, polybar, compton, gnome-terminal**  

then

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

*Optional:* you can **load my gnome-terminal profile** using **dconf**

Thanks for passing by, any contribution or suggestions except gaps or transparencies (remember it was made for productivity at the first place with no visual destruction (terminal is ok more than that is too much for me) ) are more than welcomed.
